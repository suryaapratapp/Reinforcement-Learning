* First.py file is concerned about re-implementing the results presented in Figure 2.2 of the
Sutton and Barton book which compares a greedy method with two e greedy methods for
exploration (e = 0.01 and e = 0.01) on the 10 armed bandit problem. We also discussed the
exploration-exploitation dilemma with regards to our findings.

* Second.py file is about re-implementing another results presented in Figure 6.4 of the Sutton
and Barto book comparing Sarsa and Q-learning in the cliff-walking problem. Additionally, with
